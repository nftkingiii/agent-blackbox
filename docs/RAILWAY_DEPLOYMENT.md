# Railway deployment

Agent Blackbox now runs as one Railway web service. The Node server serves the dashboard and the product API from the same domain.

## Service settings

Use these settings in Railway:

```text
Build command: npm run build
Start command: npm start
Health check path: /health
```

The included `railway.json` already sets those values for Nixpacks.

## Persistent storage

For a durable MVP, add a Railway Volume and mount it at:

```text
/data
```

Then add this environment variable:

```text
RECEIPT_STORE_PATH=/data/receipts.json
```

Without `RECEIPT_STORE_PATH`, the app stores receipts in `.data/receipts.json`, which is fine locally but not durable across production redeploys.

## Environment variables

Required for production:

```text
RECEIPT_STORE_PATH=/data/receipts.json
```

Recommended:

```text
AGENT_BLACKBOX_API_KEY=<long random server-to-server token>
AGENT_BLACKBOX_CONTRACT_HASH=hash-11c55f283a39e492201bf3f4f7e9b76436599b364c0a0fbc385d46fb3d1e5fb8
AGENT_BLACKBOX_CONTRACT_PACKAGE_HASH=hash-a738b2bdb89a6b65c71c2ae11f5b688248f38abbf463b7d487ddc2c0981a7abb

```

`AGENT_BLACKBOX_API_KEY` protects write endpoints. Leave it unset for an open public demo, or set it when teams integrate Agent Blackbox server-to-server.

## Public endpoints

```text
GET  /health
GET  /api/config
GET  /api/receipts
POST /api/receipts
GET  /api/receipts/:receiptId
POST /api/receipts/:receiptId/verify
POST /api/receipts/:receiptId/anchor
```

When `AGENT_BLACKBOX_API_KEY` is set, write requests need:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <AGENT_BLACKBOX_API_KEY>
```

## Deploy steps

1. Push the repository to GitHub.
2. Create a new Railway project from the GitHub repository.
3. Confirm Railway detects the Node app through Nixpacks.
4. Add a Volume mounted at `/data`.
5. Add `RECEIPT_STORE_PATH=/data/receipts.json`.
6. Deploy.
7. Open `/health` on the Railway domain and confirm `ok: true`.
8. Open the root page and check that the API status card says `Persisted`.

After Railway gives you the production domain, update the GitHub repository website field and README link to the new Railway URL.
